# Cursor AI Rules

## AI-Generated Content Organization

### File Location Rules

All AI-generated markdown files and context documents MUST be stored in the `/ai` directory at the project root.

**Examples of AI-generated content:**
- Implementation guides and tutorials created by AI
- Project planning documents
- Context files for AI understanding
- URL reference lists
- API documentation generated during development
- Technical summaries and overviews

**Exceptions (legitimate documentation that stays in place):**
- `README.md` at project root - main project documentation
- Component-specific `README.md` files within their directories (e.g., `src/blocks/*/README.md`)
- Official package documentation
- User-facing documentation

### Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all files in `/ai` directory
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- Examples: `reveal-animations-guide.md`, `keeper-urls.md`, `api-reference.md`

### File Management Rules

1. **Before creating new AI context files:** Check if a relevant file already exists in `/ai`
2. **Prefer updating existing files** over creating new ones
3. **Delete or merge obsolete files** instead of letting them accumulate
4. **Keep content current:** Update existing docs rather than creating "v2" files

### Workflow

When AI assistance creates markdown documentation:

1. Check `/ai` directory for existing related files
2. If exists: Update the existing file with new information
3. If new: Create file in `/ai` with clear kebab-case name
4. Periodically review and consolidate duplicate or outdated files

### Forbidden Practices

- ❌ Do NOT create AI context markdown files at the project root
- ❌ Do NOT create multiple versions of the same document (e.g., summary + guide for same topic)
- ❌ Do NOT leave obsolete AI-generated files in the repository
- ❌ Do NOT create AI documentation inside component directories (use `/ai` instead)

## Purpose

This structure keeps the repository clean, maintainable, and makes it easy to find AI-generated context and documentation in one centralized location.
