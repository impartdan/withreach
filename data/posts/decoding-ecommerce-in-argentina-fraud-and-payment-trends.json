Argentina’s economic and political history has shaped how people shop online and, in turn, how fraud shows up."

        "text": "Argentina’s economy has seen a lot of ups and downs. Currency instability and high inflation have led many people to prefer cash over digital payments. Credit card use isn’t as common, thanks to sky-high interest rates and concerns about the value of the peso.\nBecause of the country’s bigger social and economic challenges, local authorities often focus their resources on more serious crimes—meaning fraud prevention isn’t always a top priority. That makes the online space a little riskier for ecommerce businesses."

        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "In recent years, the peso hasn’t held its value well, so many Argentinians prefer to save and spend in U.S. dollars when they can. This often leads people to shop online in USD—even using VPNs to look like they're buying from the U.S.—which can trip up fraud detection systems. If your business only accepts pesos, you might see fewer conversions as a result.\nWith the use of USD for goods shipped to Argentina, out-of-the-box fraud filters might flag these transactions as suspicious just because the currency, billing address, or shipping info doesn’t line up, which leads to false declines and lost sales."

        "text": "In the past, people who don’t use their limit would sell access to their accounts to let others buy more online. This frequently leads to purchases with mismatched names and addresses. To a fraud engine, that looks shady. But in reality, it might just be someone trying to get around the system."

With fewer goods available due to import rules and tight budgets, there's high demand for small, desirable items—like phone accessories or beauty products. These “affordable luxuries” are easier to sell and less likely to draw attention than more expensive items.\nSometimes these items are bought with stolen credit card info and then sold in person with cash transactions."
