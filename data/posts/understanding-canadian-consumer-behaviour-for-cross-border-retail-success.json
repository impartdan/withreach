        "text": "Pricing is a unique topic for Canadian shoppers. Although they prefer to see prices listed in Canadian dollars (CAD) when shopping online, with the country’s proximity to the U.S., Canadians are well-versed in current exchange rates and can easily identify discrepancies. Therefore, transparency is key—customers won’t accept inflated exchange rates or hidden markups. If pricing in CAD involves a significant premium, they’ll often opt to pay in U.S. dollars instead, provided the overall cost offers better value. Retailers must strike a balance by providing competitive exchange rates and clear pricing in CAD."

        "text": "Historically, Canadian shoppers could often import goods without significant duties or taxes. However, in recent years, the government has cracked down on uncollected fees to generate revenue. Popular carriers, like FedEx and UPS, now frequently stop packages to assess additional charges, which can include both government taxes and carrier fees for handling these payments. This shift has caused friction in the shopping experience.\nRetailers must be proactive in addressing these challenges. Clear communication about potential fees and the choice between DDP and DDU helps build trust and reduce friction in the purchasing process."

Retailers should plan their promotions accordingly to capitalize on this major shopping day. Beyond Boxing Day, the general cadence of holiday shopping aligns closely with that of the U.S., making it easier for businesses to plan campaigns that appeal to both markets."
