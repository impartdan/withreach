This legislation introduces new compliance requirements for corporations, limited liability companies, and other entities operating within the U.S."

This means most companies must prepare to comply with its provisions, particularly in filing a Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) report with the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)."

This report must include detailed information about the entity’s beneficial owners and, in the case of newly formed entities, the individuals involved in the formation process. The specific deadlines for submitting these reports vary based on when the entity was established or registered."
