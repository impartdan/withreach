        "text": "When most people think of Japan, fraud probably isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. Known for its safety, order, and strong cultural values, Japan has long enjoyed a reputation as a low-crime country. But things are shifting. In 2024, fraud and scam-related losses reached a ten-year high — totaling a staggering 54 billion yen. So, what’s behind this rise, and what should businesses know if they’re operating in or looking to enter this evolving market?"

        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "One of the biggest factors is the changing dynamic between generations. Japan has a rapidly aging population, with fewer young people coming up behind them. Traditionally, the country has been guided by values like trust, honor, and honesty — passed down from older generations."

      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "But as younger people grow up in a world shaped by global media and social platforms, those traditional values are starting to shift. Many young job seekers, eager to keep up with modern lifestyles, are falling victim to job scams. These scams often look like attractive, well-paid online opportunities — but they can lead unsuspecting youth into activities like data theft or even participating in credit card fraud."

        "text": "Once trust is established, the scammer starts asking for money — sometimes for emergencies, travel expenses, or fake investments. Because the victim believes in the relationship, they may send large sums, sometimes even draining savings or taking out loans. It's a heartbreaking form of fraud that highlights the emotional and generational gaps scammers exploit."

        "text": "While it’s a smart move for preventing stolen card use, it’s not without its challenges. Many older consumers in Japan aren’t fully comfortable with digital payments as it is — and adding another layer of complexity might discourage them from completing purchases."
