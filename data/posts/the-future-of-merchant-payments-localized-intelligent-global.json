        "text": "Global e-commerce sales are expected to hit US $6.42 trillion by 2025 (emarketer). That growth comes with massive opportunity — but also with complexity. Customers expect localized payment experiences, regulators demand compliance across markets, and merchants face real costs when payments aren’t optimized."

        "text": "- E-commerce is booming. Online consumer goods spending exceeded US $4.12 trillion in 2024, growing 14.6% year over year (The Global Statistics). - Digital payments are mainstream. Nearly 90% of consumers in the U.S. and Europe report using some form of digital payments in the past year (McKinsey). - Payments are fragmented. More than 25 payment types across 48 countries drive over 90% of global GDP, creating operational headaches for merchants (McKinsey)."

      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "As Forrester notes, merchants rely on providers not just to process transactions, but to ensure payments are secure, compliant, and successful. That’s a tall order in today’s fragmented landscape — and it’s exactly why payments are now a growth lever, not just a cost center."

        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "### 1. Localized Payments = Higher Conversions"
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "Brands that don’t localize lose conversions. In fact, merchants who adapt checkout experiences to local expectations consistently report double-digit improvements in completion rates."
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "Consumers want to pay in a way that feels natural. That means:"
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "- Local currencies. - Familiar payment methods (like Afterpay, Shop Pay Installments, Klarna, or local debit schemes). - Seamless checkout experiences embedded in their preferred channels."
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "Forrester highlights localization as a critical capability for providers — and it’s one we see every day with merchants expanding globally."
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "### 2. Intelligence & Automation Are Non-Negotiable"
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "Payments aren’t just about processing anymore. They’re about optimization."
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "- AI and machine learning are being deployed to improve authorization rates, detect fraud, and dynamically route transactions. - Data-driven insights are turning payments into a revenue lever — helping merchants understand where money is being lost and where conversion can be gained. - Composable architectures and API-driven models allow brands to innovate without ripping apart their existing systems (Capgemini)."
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "As Forrester’s research reinforces, the future belongs to providers who don’t just move money — they actively help merchants grow."

        "text": "### 3. Global Scale, Local Trust"
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "Merchants want to expand fast — into new regions, new channels, new categories. But the reality is that every market comes with new layers of regulation, tax complexity, and compliance requirements."
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "- In the U.S., sales tax compliance alone is a major operational burden. - In Europe, PSD2 requirements demand stronger authentication and stricter standards. - Across APAC and LATAM, local card schemes and regulatory frameworks add further complexity."
      },
      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "Forrester highlights this tension between global ambition and local compliance. Payments providers who solve for both enable merchants to scale confidently and sustainably."

      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "- Localized checkout experiences that reduce abandonment and boost conversions. - Global tax and compliance coverage that removes operational headaches. - Data-driven optimization that helps merchants cut costs and grow revenue. - Scalable infrastructure that supports expansion without compromise."
