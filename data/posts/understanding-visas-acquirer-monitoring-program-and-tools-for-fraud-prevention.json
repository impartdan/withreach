The program holds both merchants and acquirers accountable, with stricter thresholds on allowable chargeback levels. This dual focus shifts from simply monitoring merchant behavior to evaluating the acquirer's role in managing risk within their portfolios.\nThe program's stipulations are stringent: both acquirers and merchants must keep chargeback ratios below certain levels to avoid financial penalties. For acquirers, this adds an extra layer of responsibility, encouraging proactive monitoring and mitigation of fraud risk across their portfolios."

By using pre-chargeback alerts and rapid dispute resolution methods, merchants can address potential issues before they become chargebacks. When used effectively, these tools not only prevent chargebacks but also ensure that certain resolved disputes won't count toward Visa's chargeback ratio requirements."

By setting up customized rules, such as thresholds based on transaction size or frequency, merchants can preemptively address low-value disputes and avoid fines. This layered approach allows businesses to meet Visa's tighter compliance guidelines while protecting their bottom line.\nFor merchants of all sizes, these tools serve a dual purpose: protecting businesses from fraud and maintaining healthy relationships with acquirers by staying within acceptable chargeback thresholds. With the right mix of proactive fraud management tools and strategies, businesses can comply with Visa's new standards and foster a more secure transaction environment."
