Some popular payment methods include credit cards, debit cards, digital wallets, and buy now, pay later (BNPL) services.\nBuy now, pay later (BNPL) services like Klarna and PayPal's BNPL feature are becoming increasingly popular, especially during the holiday season. These services allow customers to split their purchases into smaller, more manageable payments, which can lead to increased sales and customer loyalty. These services offer several benefits to merchants, including increased customer acquisition and higher average ticket values. By offering customers the option to pay over time, businesses can make their products more accessible and appealing, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction."

Being able to communicate between banks in different regions can be nuanced and challenging. Especially when those banks don’t already have a relationship. When customers and sellers are in different countries, the different steps in routing payments can become barred with unnecessary complications, resulting in false declines or high fees adding up.\nPartnering with the right payments team can ensure your payments are routed in the most effective way."
