        "text": "A critical aspect of digital wallets is payment security and the need for robust authentication methods. As these payment methods become more ingrained in everyday transactions, it is important to ensure that both consumers and merchants are aware of the steps they can take to keep payment data secure.\nDigital wallets use tokenization, which ensures consumer data is protected by replacing sensitive data with a single-use token. Even if the token is intercepted, it cannot be used outside of its original intended use. This reduces card-not-present fraud, and has the additional benefit of being PCI compliant."
