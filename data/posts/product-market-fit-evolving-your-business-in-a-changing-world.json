This approach often demanded significant technical resources and collaboration between teams. This approach was effective for larger retailers with bespoke platforms, but as the market evolved, these integrations became a barrier to adoption. Recognizing this, we pivoted to develop an embedded solution that eliminated the need for extensive technical integration, making their services more accessible and scalable.\nThe transition to an embedded solution highlights a broader lesson:"
