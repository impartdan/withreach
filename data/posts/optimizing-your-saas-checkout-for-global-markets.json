This shift raises a crucial question: Why charge customers once for your software when you can generate recurring revenue every month? However, transitioning to this model isn't as simple as clicking a button; it requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure success."

        "text": "The customer-initiated transaction (CIT), which is the first transaction in the subscription cycle, is the lifeblood of subscription-based businesses. This first transaction is critical for ensuring that subsequent recurring transactions are successful. The key to optimizing this process lies in minimizing friction during checkout, which can be achieved by reducing the amount of information customers need to provide.\nFor digital goods, a streamlined checkout process is essential. Businesses should focus on collecting necessary data, such as the customer's billing address and credit card information, while avoiding overwhelming them with requests for excessive details. This balance is vital—too little information can lead to authorization declines, while too much can deter potential subscribers from completing their transactions."

        "text": "Authorization rates can significantly impact a business's bottom line, especially for subscription services. In the U.S., many digital businesses see authorization rates drop to 50-60% for cross-border transactions compared to 80-90% in domestic markets. This discrepancy is often attributed to the differences in how banks handle international transactions, as they may flag them as high risk, leading to declines.\nBusinesses must be proactive in addressing these challenges. For instance, providing full billing information rather than just ZIP codes can help improve authorization rates. The goal is to ensure that banks clearly understand the nature of the transaction, thus reducing the likelihood of declines due to perceived fraud."

      {
        "blockType": "paragraph",
        "text": "Expanding into international markets introduces additional complexities. Companies may find that while U.S. customers present a lucrative opportunity, the costs associated with advertising and acquiring these customers can skyrocket if authorization rates are low. This is particularly true for software companies based outside the U.S. trying to sell to American consumers.\nOne effective strategy to mitigate these challenges is to consider using a merchant of record. This approach allows businesses to leverage a third-party distributor to handle transactions in the U.S. market, thus avoiding the need to establish a physical entity in the country. This not only simplifies compliance with local regulations but also helps optimize authorization rates."
