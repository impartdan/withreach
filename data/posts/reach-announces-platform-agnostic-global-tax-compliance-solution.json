        "text": "The challenges of selling cross-border into international markets don’t end with payment processing and logistics. Many online businesses don’t realize that they must also be registered with domestic tax authorities, and calculate, file, and remit sales tax, VAT, GST and duties. The penalties for not complying with local tax laws can be severe, and extend beyond large fines into the realm of criminal prosecution."

And those crackdowns can be harsh.”"
